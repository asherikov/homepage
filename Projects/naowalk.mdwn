## Introduction

The project is focused on development of a specialized solver for a 
quadratic model predictive control problem, and a software module, 
which uses this solver to control walking behavior of a 
[[Nao|http://www.aldebaran-robotics.com]] humanoid robot.

The development has been performed within the
[[Mobile Robotics and Olfaction Lab |http://www.aass.oru.se/Research/Learning/index.html]]
at &Ouml;rebro University under the supervision of Dimitar Dimitrov 
(<http://www.drdv.net>).



## Source code and documentation

* The Nao module:

* The inverse kinematics library:

Note, that the code of this library is partially generated by Maple, Maple
sources and different versions of the inverse kinematics functions are stored
in a separate branch:

## Video demonstration

There are several videos recorded from different viewpoints, they can be chosen
from a playlist.

the original walking module included in the standard software:
